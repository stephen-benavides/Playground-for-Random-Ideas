Abstract Modifier 
	- Indicates that a class or a member is missing implementation
	- Define it in a class and implement it in another class 

	- PIC 1 - Abstract Shape
		- There is no way to define a draw method for a shape as it is too abstract, it is better to implement it anywhere else but shape thus use abstract for the class 
		- Indicate it is missing an implementation 

	- PIC 2 - Abstract Implementation
		- Abstract methods are VIRTUAL by default 
			- No need to define the method as virtual, it is replaced with abstract 
		- The class and at leat 1 method must be abstract 
		- The abstract method(that is missing the implementation) does not have a body, only a signature 
		- The impementation is provideed by a derived class 
		
		- If a member is abstract the class must be abstract too 
		- You must override ALL the abstract methods from a class in a derived class 

		- They cannot be instantiated, as they are missing implementation 
			- var shape = new Shape() // NOT POSSIBLE, WON't compile

		- Use to implement a common behavior and other developer must comply, in this case other develpers must provide a declaration for the draw method in a shape 

		- Use the abstract to force the developer to override a method 

		- Abstract classes can have non abstract methods
