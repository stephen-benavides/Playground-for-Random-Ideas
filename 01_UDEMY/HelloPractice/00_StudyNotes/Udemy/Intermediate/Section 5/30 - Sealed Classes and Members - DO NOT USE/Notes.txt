Sealed Modifier 
	- Same as "final" in java 
	- Prevents override of methods 
	- Prevents derivation of classes 

	- It can only be applied to methodd/classes that are overriding data from a parent class 
	- Only usable if the previous modifier is virtual 
	- If you are not overriding a method then you dont need sealed 
	- It is use for optimizations
		- Almost never used 

	- Anti-pattern 
	- DO NOT USE unless is strictely needed 

	- If you want to use them in other classes you need to apply extension methods
