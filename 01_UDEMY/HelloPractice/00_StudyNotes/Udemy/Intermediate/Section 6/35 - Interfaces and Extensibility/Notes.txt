Interfaces are the middle man to communicate with a class

- Pass an interface as a dependency injection 
- Implement the methods in another class 

- by inheritance the class will have the other implementations 
- In the main method you can create the instance for the Ilogger 
	- To pass the instance of ConsoleLogger as an ILogger 

-PIC 07
	- Easier to make changes to the objects without changing other classes and changing the object that is passed as type of ILogger

- PIC 08 - OPC - Open Close Principle 
	- Software entities should be open for extension but close for modifications 
	- DBMigrator is closed for any modifications as none can be performed 
		- But Open for modication by using logger private field and dependency injection through the ctor 

	- Interfaces provide polymorphism 

PIC 09 - Polymorphism Interface
	- We do not care who implements the method, we only care about what is doing 
	- Best principle of interfaces to allow polymorphic behavior 
	- This class follows OCP 
		- It is closed for changes and open for modifications throuh the interface
