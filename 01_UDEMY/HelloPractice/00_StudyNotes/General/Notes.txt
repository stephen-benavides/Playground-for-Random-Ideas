02 - Applying USING keyword
	- To dispose of object that are not necessary after the usage to avoid memory leakage 
	- It is implemented here to destroy the new object StreamWriter after usage
	- disposes the method
	- calls method.dispose 


04 -  Pass Multiple Interfaces
	- It is possible to pass multiple interfaces in C# 

	Inheritance - Reusability 
	Interfaces - Let other method implement an interface 
		- Interfaces are contracts that need to pass a specific method and implment it 
		- You can't pass fields 
		- Interfaces provide polymorphism 


05 - Add elements to private readonly
	- add elements to the field by opening a a public method that passes interface variable to the application  

06 - Protect list readonly
	- Protect the implementation by using IEnumerable so the user does not go directly to the list that is being implemented


PASS VARIABLE ARGUMENTS IN ARRAY 
	- In java is known as varargs (variable arguments) 
		- It is passed as (int ... num)
	- In C# is also nown as varargs 
		- It is passed as 
		- (params int[] num)
